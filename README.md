# Open-CV-for-python-
This repository contains files that I created while learning OpenCV for python from youtube channel ProgrammingKnowledge.
They provide tutorials good enough to learn basics about any programming language or module which can be used in a project.
Link for one of the videos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVBVqVmHtfc&list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K&index=34

I am using pictures from the tutorial. See the tutorial to get the source for them.

There comments in files which to make understanding of the code and its concepts easy and smooth.

I was learning OpenCV for purpose understanding the module which I am implementing for another project that I am doing under professor in my Institute.
